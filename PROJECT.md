Please do not edit this document without asking me first.

**Project type**
I want to make a web app that users can log into and add journal content to. The journal content should be stored in a database. The users will be equestrian amateurs who will use the journal to reflect on their riding, so we will refer to the users as "riders" in this document.

**Technology stack**
I would like to host the app on a droplet at DigitalOcean. The app should be written in Django. I want riders to be able to submit both text and images.

**Key features**
Riders will log in by choosing the name of their horse and then the rider's name; this way, a single horse can be attached to multiple riders. When they submit some journal content, the content should be added to the database so that it can be reread later. There should be a button that allows the rider to alert the head trainer (named Michelle) so that she can read the latest entry and comment on it.
